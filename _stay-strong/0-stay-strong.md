During this COVID-19 period, our lives have been profoundly changed. As we adapt to a new normal, it is natural for us to feel stressed or anxious. Others around us may also be feeling the same way too.

We can take active steps to manage our emotions. We can also do our part to support others who are feeling stressed or anxious. Together, we can get through these unprecedented times, and emerge as a stronger and more caring community.

Together, we can Brave the New.

Being aware of our feelings is an important first step in helping us manage our anxieties and take action to change the way we feel. We can spend some time to do a self-check in to assess how we are feeling and why we are feeling this way.

The next step we can take is to stay calm. After all, these are extraordinary times and it takes time to process and accept the new normal. Mindful exercises can help us focus on the present instead of all the negative things that can possibly happen. Some exercises we can practise include progressive relaxation, deep breathing and mindfulness.

Once we are in a calmer state of mind, we can then try to change the way we view the situation. We can also look for new opportunities to make the best of the situation. Here are some tips that we can adopt to change our mindset:

|---|---|
|Displace anxious thoughts|Instead of focusing on the uncertainties and negatives, we can try to engage in things that we find enjoyable, such as hobbies and personal interests. This can help displace our anxious thoughts and prevent us from heading into a downward spiral.|
|Be positive|Being positive doesn’t mean we avoid our negative feelings. Instead, we can put things into perspective and focus on what we have. For example, while we may be worried about the possibility of losing our jobs, we can also choose to think optimistically and seize new opportunities presented by the situation, such as picking up new skills during our downtime to upgrade ourselves and increase our employability.|

|Be flexible and open to new possibilities|Often, we feel frustrated when we run into challenges that seem insurmountable or are beyond our control. However, as daunting as it may seem, we can turn these challenges into opportunities if we are flexible and open to alternatives. The key is to identify what we can do instead of focusing on the loss. For example, if we find it challenging to find a job in our current field, we can grasp the opportunity to move into a different industry.|

Beyond taking care of ourselves, we can also reach out to support others who may be experiencing feelings of anxiety or stress. The simple act of expressing concern can make all the difference to them.

Sometimes, all it takes is a listening ear. Sharing our time to listen can play a big role in helping others feel heard. 

Be mindful that these feelings can be complex, and remember to give them time to express how they feel. We should also try putting ourselves in their shoes to understand how they feel. It helps to be empathetic and to avoid using judgemental statements or to trivialise their problems.

In the same way someone who is feeling unwell would need extra help and support, sometimes people need extra help to support their mental well-being as well. We can help by prompting them to start thinking about what they can do for themselves, such as using the coping tips on this page. If they seem overly anxious and require further help, we can also encourage them to seek professional help. But if they are not ready to do so, we should be patient and respect their decision. Let them know you are available to support them in seeking help whenever they need you.
