### Our five calls to action:

In response to our first COVID deaths, here are our five alls to action:
- COVID is deadly, and let's take precautions seriously to keep ourselves and others around us healthy.
- Comfort the families afflicted and consider contributing to **[The Courage Fund](https://www.giving.sg/community-chest/thecouragefund)**. Reassure friends who are anxious or scared.
- Appreciate the healthcare workers, and encourage them. Don’t let the first deaths discourage them from their hard work. Don’t let misplaced fear be a cause to shun them. 
- Speak up for hope and positivity, and take a stand against fear and the negative. 
- By working together, we can get through this.
