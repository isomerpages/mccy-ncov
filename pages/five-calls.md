### Our five calls to action:
- Take care of your personal hygiene, to keep yourself and those around you healthy.
- Reassure and take care of one another - friend, co-worker, neighbour 
- Express appreciation for those working hard for us.
- Speak up for hope and care, and stand against the negative
- Support your neighbours on home quarantine and co-workers on leave of absence from work - they are being responsible
