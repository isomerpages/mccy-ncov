- **[The Courage Fund](https://www.giving.sg/community-chest/thecouragefund)** was established in 2003 when Singapore was hit by SARS. Fellow Singaporeans donated generously to the Fund to support those who were affected by the outbreak. In this same spirit of uniting the community to support one another through difficult times, Community Chest is helping to channel donations to The Courage Fund to enable those in need to tide through the COVID-19 situation.

[![The Sayang Sayang Fund](/images/TSSF.jpeg)](https://www.giving.sg/community-foundation-of-singapore/sayang_sayang_fund)
- **[The Sayang Sayang Fund](https://www.giving.sg/community-foundation-of-singapore/sayang_sayang_fund)** aims to provide transport vouchers to staff in healthcare institutions and other selfless healthcare professionals, like home care nurses and those in nursing homes and shelters. The Fund will also go to charities that help those who have been further challenged by the heightened precautionary measures, such as vulnerable seniors and low income families.

You can visit **[Giving.SG](https://www.giving.sg/sgunited)** to give to more initiatives by various charities to address the needs of communities.
