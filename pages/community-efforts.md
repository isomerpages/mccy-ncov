### Supporting Mental Health and Wellness during COVID-19

### Community Initiatives to Support Local Businesses
Amidst the COVID-19 situation, support packages have been provided to business and workers to tide them through this period; as customers, we too can play a part in helping them. Visit [ChopeAndSave](https://www.chopeandsave.com) to purchase a gift card from your favourite shop for you, your friends and loved ones to use at a later date.

Our businesses and workers have made sacrifices to keep us safe. Let us support them through this period, and make their efforts count by staying at home, and when out, keep a safe distance from one another.

### Collaborate with other Companies
The [Company of Good](https://www.companyofgood.sg/collaborate)’s Collaborate platform is for companies seeking other companies to work together on impactful initiatives that address key needs during this period. Visit them:
- If you are a company looking for partners or additional support to scale your initiatives, **share an opportunity** with the Company of Good community.
- If you are a company looking to partner, **view the opportunities** and connect with the company directly to get started.
