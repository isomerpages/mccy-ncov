### Donations, Volunteerism Surge in February Aiding COVID-19 Response Efforts and Other Causes 

Giving.sg, a one-stop giving platform managed by the National Volunteer and Philanthropy Centre (NVPC) saw a sharp rise in donations and volunteer sign-ups for the month of February 2020. This increase comes in the midst of Singaporeâ€™s fight against COVID-19. The site saw an increase of 67 percent in donations received, and a 10 jump in volunteer sign-ups compared to the same time last year.
