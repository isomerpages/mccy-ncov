### Non-profit New Life Stories prepares 84 cleaning and self-care packages for 149 children

Non-profit New Life Stories prepared 84 cleaning and self-care packages for 149 children to provide them with the necessary resources to protect themselves against the spread of the virus. Through this package, they hope to encourage children to practice good personal hygiene both at home, and when they are out and about in society. The package comes with hand sanitisers, face masks and disinfectants, as well as self-care items such as Vitamin-C pastilles to boost their immunity and antioxidant tea to encourage families to stay calm during these stressful times.
