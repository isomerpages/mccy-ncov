### Montfort Junior School Students Appreciate Frontline Community

It started as a project to help students understand and appreciate the courage, dedication and resilience displayed by healthcare, frontline and transportation workers; and wanting to show support for them. And so, together with teachers, students made cards and penned down words of appreciation and encouragement to them. Parents were also encouraged to get involved.

On Valentine's Day, students from Monfort Junior School sent out the cards together with some apples to our healthcare workers at Hougang Polyclinic, SCDF staff as well as Bus Captains at Hougang Interchange. They hope that it brought some smiles and encouragement.
