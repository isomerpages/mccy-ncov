### My Friend Next Door - 3 Short Films on Good Neighbourliness

The National Volunteer Philanthropy Centre (NVPC) and My Friend Next Door (MFND) are co-hosting a watch party on Facebook. This is in the hopes of gathering people in the digital space, do something fun and participate in meaningful conversations. Since it is the March school holidays, it will be a great opportunity for families to get together as well!

The FB Watch Party will be happening on Friday, 20 Mar, at 8pm and will feature 3 short films by locally acclaimed directors.
