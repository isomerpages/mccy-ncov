### Inter-faith Prayer by Religious Leaders to Boost Solidarity

On 15 Feb 2020, we commemorated Total Defence Day to remind ourselves that, we, the people [of Singapore], must defend our country. As we continue our battle against Covid-19, Inter-Religious Organisation (IRO) leaders joined the front line of Singaporeâ€™s solidarity in collective prayer.

_We thank our religious leaders for boosting the psychological resilience among our people._

_It is also crucial for us to do our part to stop the spread of falsehoods on Covid-19 and defend our society digitally._

_Together we pray for and protect our Singapore._
