### NTU Undergraduate Shares on Why He Decided to Volunteer in Delivery Initiative

When Tristan Goh, 23, found out about a delivery initiative through the NTU Student Union, he decided on volunteering to deliver meals to students quarantined in NTU's graduate hall in early-February.

Besides delivering meals, volunteers also packed welfare packs for the students. It made him happy when he got to see them showing their appreciation.

By being part of this initiative, he wanted to show that everyone is human. Besides actively volunteering, he also rallied classmates to help out as they needed more manpower.

_"There’s a lot of volunteers involved and everyone’s coming together at this time of need. It shows that the student body is quite united.”_
