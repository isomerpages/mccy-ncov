### International Women's Day: Recognising the Women of All Ages in Our Community

As we continue to battle COVID-19, we want to remember and recognise the women of all ages in our community! 

On International Women's Day on 8 March 2020, Fei Yue partnered with Keat Hong Women Executive Committee (WEC) to reach out to single mothers, low-income women and women with caregiving needs to distribute care packages which included hand sanitisers, wet wipes, disinfectants and a $20 NTUC card. 

Let's continue to work as one Singapore to tide through this period!
