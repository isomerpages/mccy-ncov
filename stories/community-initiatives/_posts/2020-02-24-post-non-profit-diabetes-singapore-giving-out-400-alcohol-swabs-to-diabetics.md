### Non-profit Diabetes Singapore Giving Out 400 Alcohol Swabs to Diabetics 

In light of the COVID-19 outbreak which saw people scrambling to purchase masks, hand sanitisers and groceries, some who needed these items might have been deprived of it.

This was the case when alcohol swabs ran out at numerous stores and pharmacies, leaving some patients with diabetes being unable to obtain them.

Non-profit Diabetes Singapore however, has stepped forward to provide some relief for those suffering from the medical condition.

In a [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/thediabetessingapore/posts/10156605622307143) post on Feb. 16, the organisation announced it would be distributing 400 free care packs to diabetics, sponsored by Aeras Medical.
