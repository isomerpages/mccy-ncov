### Healthcare Frontliners Volunteer for the SGUnited Buka Puasa Initiative

Doctors Fadzil Hamzah, 39, and Nurhidayati Binte Mohamed Suphan, 46, are among the busiest frontliners as the COVID-19 situation escalates, but they still made time to volunteer for the SGUnited Buka Puasa initiative; a joint effort to provide meals for breaking of fast during the Ramadan period.

“It’s a great ground-up initiative,” says Dr Fadzil. “For people who are affected, it eases the burden so they need not worry about what they are going to eat for the month. Although Ramadan will be different this year, the initiative offers family meals through the act of sharing, which still reflects the meaning of the season.”

Dr Nurhidayati recognises that volunteer efforts can have an outsized impact. “For some, this period is very difficult. They may be alone at home or with compromised mobility. It can also get expensive if you are feeding a family of 4 or 5, so this is meaningful for people who really need it.”
