### Campaign to make workers feel welcome in housing estates

A group of volunteers have launched a campaign to encourage Singaporeans to be more welcoming when migrant workers are relocated to housing estates in a bid to curtail the coronavirus.

The initiative - Welcome In My Backyard (Wimby) - is a direct response to concerns that people will adopt a "not in my backyard" (Nimby) stance at the prospect of workers turning up in their estates.

That prospect is a real one with Singapore embarking on an unprecedented effort to relocate healthy workers from the industrial peripheries of the island to alternative sites, including HDB blocks.

The campaign, which kicked off on Friday, 17 April, will involve local ambassadors living in communities that will house workers. They will try to debunk stereotypes and reframe narratives about foreign workers, and provide feedback on how locals are feeling.
