### IKEA donates 800 mugs & snacks to migrant workers

Swedish furniture retail company IKEA has donated 800 mugs and cartons of snacks to migrant workers in dormitories.

This comes after the migrant workers were spotted drinking milk straight from the carton as they had no mugs. 

Ground-up, Itsrainingraincoats took to Facebook to share this heartwarming story. 

For the uninformed, Itsrainingraincoats is a local initiative that aims to spread kindness to migrant workers in Singapore. According to them, one of their long term donors had sent cartons of fresh milk to migrant workers in the past week. However, when one of their volunteers saw photos of the workers, she realised that they were drinking milk straight from the carton. After making some inquiries, she found out that it was because the workers had no mugs.

Upon knowing this, Itsrainingraincoats immediately activated a team of donors.

IKEA soon got involved and ended up donating 800 mugs for the workers and cartons of snacks from their food outlet.
