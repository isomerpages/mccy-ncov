### Project MERCI Appreciates Cleaners Islandwide

The kind folks from Project MERCI headed out to 33 hawker centres across the island to share some love with the people who keep them clean and safe for all of us.

This youth-initiated project, had hope to spread warmth and a spirit filled with love and care to these unsung heroes (cleaners) islandwide, and to bring across a message that they would always have the support of Singaporeans during this period.

Merci beaucoup to Project MERCI as well!
