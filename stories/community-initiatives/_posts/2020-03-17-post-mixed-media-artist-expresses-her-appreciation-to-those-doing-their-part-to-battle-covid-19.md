### Mixed Media Artist Expresses Her Appreciation to Those Doing their Part to Battle COVID-19

Judith, a mixed media artist, created a collage artwork to convey her appreciation to the community and those at the frontline for doing their part to battle the COVID-19 outbreak.

She said, "For me, this piece is about the courage of healthcare workers to work and live on the frontline (without compromising on the health of other patients), as well as the courage of citizens to do the right thing despite inconvenience (to mask up and avoid public spaces when sick)." She also credits the people in the cleaning services, the food industry, events and venues because the virus spread hits the industries dealing with face-to-face interactions the hardest. 

"To everyone affected by Covid-19 both now and in the next few months, may we all have the courage to come through this together and have the strength to appreciate our fellow human beings more."
