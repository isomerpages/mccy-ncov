### Church and Community Partners Appreciate Staff at Khoo Teck Puat Hospital

The Heart of God Church wanted to do their part to appreciate healthcare professionals holding up the front lines amidst the COVID-19 situation.

And so, together with its community partners, the Khadijah Mosque, Geylang United Temple, Nanyang Leow-Sih Association and Huang Clan Association, gathered together to prepare and distribute 300 care packs containing an assortment of fruits, vitamin-C and heartfelt notes to healthcare professionals at Khoo Teck Puat Hospital.

_To our heroes, thank you for your courage and commitment. You've cared for so many in this critical time. Now, it's our turn to care for you!_
