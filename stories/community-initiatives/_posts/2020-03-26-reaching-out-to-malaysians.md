### Reaching Out to Homeless Malaysia Workers

Many asked why #OpsRoofUp was started as a new outreach with limited resources. Their reply, “This is our philosophy of an ‘Upstander’- we see a need, so we stand up and fill the need... so when someone else believe in continuing our mission, we stand down so that they can continue the work and do it better... then we continue looking for other needs to fulfil.” 

Delane Lim, founder of ground-up initiative #OpsHandsOn quickly put together a team of volunteers to reach out and distribute #OpsRoofUp kits (sleeping bags, pillows, toiletries, hand sanitisers and masks) to stranded Malaysian workers in Singapore.

A huge thank you to the #OpsHandsOn team!
