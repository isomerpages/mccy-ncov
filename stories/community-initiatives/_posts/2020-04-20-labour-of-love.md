### Singapore Housewives Sew Adorable Cloth Masks For The Needy, SingPost Sponsors Labour Of Love

Over the past 13 days of ‘Circuit Breaker’ (CB), many Singaporeans have resorted to whipping up cups of dalgona coffee or trying new workout challenges on YouTube in a bid to pass time.

A group of local housewives, however, came together to do something more meaningful during the Circuit Breaker period.

They joined a new initiative named ‘Masks Sewn With Love’ to provide free face masks for the needy. Joining the wholesome project, SingPost will also be assisting to deliver these hand-sewn masks for free.

After finishing a batch, volunteers would seal them in an envelope and drop them off at a mailbox.

Simply by labelling them with “Masks Sewn With Love”, SingPost will deliver the finished products to its respective destinations.
