### DPM Heng and Team Singapore Cheer SCDF Personnel at Kallang Fire Station

_From the start of the COVID-19 outbreak three weeks ago, our healthcare and frontline workers have been working round the clock to care for patients and keeping Singaporeans safe._

_Met some of our frontline Singapore Civil Defence Force personnel at Kallang Fire Station today. Handling COVID-19-related duties are now part of their day-to-day operations, such as the emergency ambulance crew conveying suspected COVID-19 cases and supporting temperature screening at Changi Airport. This is on top of their usual responsibilities of responding to fires and other 995 emergencies._

_Even as we are dealing with the challenges and uncertainties now, the SCDF officers were in good spirits and team morale was high. I was impressed by their professional and calm demeanour during the briefing and demonstration. Our Team Singapore athletes were there on the ground too ‚Äî to show their support, cheering on our heroes and heroines in blue, with ice cream in hand!_ üç¶

_Such ground-up support may be a simple gesture but they demonstrate the best of our Singapore spirit ‚Äî to show how our frontline warriors are not alone in tackling this outbreak. Together, we can overcome this outbreak, as well as emerge stronger and more united, as one people._
