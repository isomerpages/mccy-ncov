### Youth-led ground-up organises donation drive for frontline healthcare teams

A youth-led ground-up Refresh Flowers SG organised a Valentine's Day public drive for people to donate Valentinesâ€™ Day flowers to frontline healthcare teams.

A huge 'thank you' to those who donated flowers and penned words of encouragement - digitally and in person! A total of 175 bouquets were created in appreciation of our Healthcare Heroes!
