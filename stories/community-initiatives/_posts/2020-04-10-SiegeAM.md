### These 2 Singaporean youths produce & donate 3D-printed face shields to hospitals from their own printing startup

On a regular day, the duoâ€™s 3D printing startup, Siege Advanced Manufacturing, does printing for both mass and customised 3D prints.

However, due to the Covid-19 outbreak, both Daphne and Chi Jie have recently converted a majority of their 3D printing capacity to produce face shields. The face shields can be used as an emergency Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) for frontline workers.
