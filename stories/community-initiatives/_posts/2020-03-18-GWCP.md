### Educating the Young on Impact of Epidemic With Get Well Card Project

A class of Primary 6 pupils at Madrasah Wak Tanjong Al-Islamiah discussed the COVID-19 outbreak and made cards for the community last Thursday as a part of a ground-up initiative called The Get Well Card Project.

The project aims to educate primary pupils and lower secondary school students about issues that have risen as a result of the epidemic, such as xenophobia, personal hygiene and the impact to the community and economy.

Launched by Madam Rahimah Rahim, 53, the project it will be rolled out to selected schools, including Radin Mas Primary School, Yio Chu Kang Primary School, Canossian School, and Dunearn Secondary School.

She was inspired by similar efforts by other Singaporeans to start an initiative to spread kindness in view of the outbreak and tapped [Our Singapore Fund](https://www.sg/oursingaporefund) for funding support.

The fund - made up of grants from the Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth, Tote Board and the Singapore Centre for Social Enterprise - supports community initiatives that meet social needs.
