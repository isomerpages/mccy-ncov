### Paya Lebar Residents Prepare 1000 Care Packs for Distribution to Healthcare Workers

Paya Lebar Youth Network and People's Association Integration Naturalisation Champions prepared 1000 care packs for distribution to clinics in Paya Lebar, Hougang Polyclinic, Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH) and the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID). Items in these care packs include handwritten notes by children and families of the Paya Lebar community, healthy snacks, Vitamin C and drinks.

Thank you for caring for our healthcare workers!
