### Singaporean creates a Bengali translation website to help healthcare workers and affected migrant workers

As the number of cases involving migrant workers continue to grow, one Singaporean youth wanted to do something about the "thick language barrier" between healthcare workers and affected migrant workers.

On Apr 14, 24-year-old medicine graduate Sudesna Roy Chowdhury decided to create a [translation website](https://sudesnaroychowdhury.wixsite.com/covid), offering free resources to help healthcare workers communicate better with Bangladeshi patients. It also helps that Sudesna is well-versed in Bengali. She has been volunteering as a translator and helping doctors over the phone.

She also roped in her parents and her sister, who works as an emergency doctor, to translate medical terms and instructions into Bengali. Sudesna and her family worked overnight to develop the website and record audio translations before launching it at 11am the next day.
