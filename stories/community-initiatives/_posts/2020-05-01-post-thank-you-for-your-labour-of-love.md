### Thank you for your Labour of Love

Labour Day is marked as a day where we celebrate the contributions of our workforce. For our workers who are performing essential services, there has not been a time in Singaporeâ€™s history that your contributions have been more vital to our survival.

Many people in our workforce will also face very difficult times ahead so we hope that this little show of support will give them a brighter horizon to look forward to. We must bounce back stronger and do our best to leave no man behind. We also want to say thank you to our migrant worker friends who have so often been overlooked in one way or another. It is and always will be a work in progress but we should never stop striving to do better by the ones who help build our homes.

In conjunction with Labour Day, @wearemajulah dedicates a video tribute to all workers!
