### DBS Deliver Care Packages to Hospitals and Communities

DBS is collaborating with social enterprises supported by the DBS Foundation and vendors to distribute care packages and food and beverage treats to healthcare professionals in the wake of the COVID-19 situation.

Over the next two weeks, 25,000 staff from seven public hospitals will receive care packages containing items such as kits to ease muscle aches and pains, moisturisers, and facial masks.

The slew of initiatives kicked off last Friday (21 Feb) as healthcare staff at Tan Tock Seng Hospital and SGH were given treats such as coffee and healthy snacks by social enterprises Foreword Coffee and BoxGreen.

_"Together with our social enterprise partners and vendors, we would like to show our support and gratitude for their dedication and sacrifice. We also hope that our small gesture will encourage and remind them that there is strength in numbers, and we will overcome this virus together."_ - Shee Tse Koon, DBS Singapore
