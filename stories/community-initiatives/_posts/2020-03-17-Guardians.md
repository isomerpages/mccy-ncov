### Guardians of Our Borders

When ICA officer, Staff Sergeant (SSGT) Anisah received the news that volunteers were needed to clear a flight from Wuhan on 9 February 2020, she volunteered without hesitation. Her reason? To help fellow Singaporeans who were stranded and bring them back to their loved ones. ‚Å£We salute SSGT Anisah and many other brave frontline workers for the vital role they play in Singapore's fight against COVID-19!
