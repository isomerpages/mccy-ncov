### Local Hawkers Prepare 70 Free Meals for Healthcare Workers

Local hawkers, Yap Kee Wanton Noodles and Shimaâ€™s Kitchen prepared 70 free meals for heatlhcare workers at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID).

Together with other volunteers who coordinated the effort and offered transport, the meals were also coupled with some beautiful thank you cards from #BraveHeartSG written by Singaporeans from all over!

A huge thank you to all!
