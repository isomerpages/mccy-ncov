### Alone We Can Do So Little, Together We Can Do So Much

Last week, non-profit Soap Cycling Singapore joined hands with MigrantxMe and SGCares Tai Seng Centre to kickstart their first round of soap distribution to migrant workers.
This was made possible with the help of migrant worker volunteers, and youths from Lush Singapore who dedicated their time to reprocess and pack over 1,500 soap bars.

We can all make a difference. Start an idea with a friend or family with [The Majurity Trust](https://www.majurity.sg/sgstrong)
