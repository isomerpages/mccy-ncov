### Are Singaporean Youths Taking COVID-19 Seriously Enough?

Over the weekend, the World Health Organization (WHO) issued a strong statement to young people worldwide regarding the COVID-19 pandemic: "You are not invincible."

"This virus could put you in hospital for weeks or even kill you. Even if you don't get sick the choices you make about where you go could be the difference between life and death for someone else," said WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus at a virtual press conference on Mar 20.
