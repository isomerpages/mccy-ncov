### 72 year-old runs Ukulele livestreams for seniors during Circuit Breaker

Knowing that many of his members were seniors who lived by themselves, Serangoon Wellness Programme Ukulele Interest Group founder Dick Yip was adamant that they never lapse into loneliness even when they are home alone due to COVID-19.

Despite being a self-proclaimed 'IT dinosaur' at one point, 72 year-old Dick now runs Ukulele livestreams twice a week on Facebook for seniors to come together online amidst 'Circuit Breaker' measures.

Kudos!
