### Ground-up Group Appreciating Our Migrant Workers

Amidst all the ups and downs of the COVID-19 situation, one thing remains unchanged: the dedication and commitment of ground-up It’s Raining Raincoats' (IRR) volunteers to collect unsold food at 10.30 pm multiple times a week and pass it to migrant workers who are toiling away at that late hour. The workers deserve our thanks, our respect and our compassion: it’s the very least we can do.
