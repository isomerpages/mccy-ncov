### The National Kidney Foundation conveys their appreciation to nurses

Happy International Nurses Day to all of our nurses! 

Hereâ€™s a special dedication to each and every one of you, who have been out there fighting against COVID-19 on our behalf. Your selflessness and dedication to provide continuous care and support to our patients have been great and appreciated by all of us!
