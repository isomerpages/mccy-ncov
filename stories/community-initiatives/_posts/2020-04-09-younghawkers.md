### 2 young S'porean hawkers cook for the needy during COVID-19 circuit breaker, refuse to accept donations

With the circuit breaker in place in Singapore, all non-essential services have been suspended until the end of this period.

Two young hawkers running Beng Who Cooks, Jason Chua and Zhen Long, have started an initiative to prepare meals for anybody who's unable to afford meals until the end of the circuit breaker and have refused to accept donations for this initiative.
