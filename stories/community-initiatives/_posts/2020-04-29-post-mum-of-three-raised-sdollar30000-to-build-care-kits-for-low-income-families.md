### Mum-of-three raised S$30,000 to build care kits for low-income families

The “circuit breaker” has disrupted many aspects of our daily lives, but parents with children born between April and May are faced with an added dilemma – how do you celebrate your child’s birthday?

One Singaporean mum of three decided that the best way to celebrate her daughter’s second birthday was to give her the gift of giving back. 

So Juwel (Nyla) Ang – Nyla refers to the name she took after converting to Islam – created Amelia’s Rainbow Fund, a charity initiative named after her daughter, to raise money for the purchasing, packing and distributing of care kits to low-income families with children.
