### Chicken Rice Stall Starts “Pay It Forward” Campaign, Public Can Donate To Those In Need For Just $4 A Meal

We’re a week into the ‘Circuit Breaker’, and it looks like more hawkers are finding ways to support others, despite the social distancing.

OK Chicken Rice in Ang Mo Kio is one of them. It has been no stranger to giving back to the community, and now it has not one, but two programmes offering free food to those in need.

With these programmes, you can show your support for others and belanja (treat) them to a free meal during the ‘Circuit Breaker’.
