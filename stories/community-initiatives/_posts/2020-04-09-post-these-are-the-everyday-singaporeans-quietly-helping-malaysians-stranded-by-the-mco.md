### These Are the Everyday Singaporeans Quietly Helping Malaysians Stranded By The MCO

Malaysia’s Movement Control Order (MCO) was originally supposed to end on 31 March. It was later extended to 14 April. Due to the increasing number of Covid-19 cases there, the MCO may be extended further, with restrictions in some areas within Malaysia partially lifted. For Malaysians stuck in Singapore since 18 March, the long wait and separation from families back home couldn’t be more agonising. Some Singaporean residents have stepped forward to provide respite, by coordinating food and clothing donations, as well as providing logistical assistance for stranded Malaysians.
