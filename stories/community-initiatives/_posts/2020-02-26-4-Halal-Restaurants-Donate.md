### 4 Halal Restaurants Donate Over 4,300 boxes of Food to Healthcare Workers

In an effort to help healthcare workers during this troubling period, Berita Mediacorp reported that halal restaurants Rumah Makan Minang, Hjh Maimunah, Positano and Kinamaya gave away over 4,000 curry puffs, 250 samosas, 70 boxes of pasta and 60 packets of chicken rice to over 100 staff from the Singapore General Hospital (SGH) on 17 Feb.

This was in support of healthcare and frontline staff who strive to protect Singapore.
