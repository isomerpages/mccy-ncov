### Community Project Starfish: Supporting Seniors during Circuit Breaker Period

As we stay home to keep ourselves and our loved ones safe, there are some elderly residents who live alone and need help with their basic necessities. Volunteers from Project Starfish, a seniorsâ€™ Befrienders programme at Kebun Baru have been meeting these residents bi-monthly before the COVID-19 outbreak. When the Circuit Breaker measures kicked in, these volunteers were worried for the elderly residents who have pre-existing health conditions and no family support.

Amy Foo from Project Starfish has met these seniors during her Befrienders sessions. She shares "I used to meet 10 residents on a monthly basis and I have grown to know them very well. I am scared that they will be exposed to the virus if they head out. Now, I visit 15 houses everyday. Although it can be tiring to visit all the houses, it is nothing compared to knowing that they are safe in their homes with at least two meals on their table. Everything becomes meaningful when we see them smile."
