### This is home, truly: Singaporeans unite in nationwide singalong

This is home, truly. There's no better song to sing now than Home, as Singapore continues to deal with the COVID-19 situation. 

On Saturday (Apr 25), singer-songwriter Dick Lee, together with celebrities such as Felicia Chin and Taufik Batisah, led a nationwide singalong of 'Home' at 8pm to show appreciation towards our frontline workers and volunteers.

This is home, truly. Singapore, we cheer in good times together and we come as one in times of need. 

And we definitely can do this together!
