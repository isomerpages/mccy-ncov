### Heroes Unmasked: She knits extensions for face-mask straps for her tudung-wearing colleagues, front-line workers

After her Muslim colleagues told Ms Neo Su Yin, 40, that they had to visit the restroom to remove the surgical masks they wore under their tudung whenever they had a meal or drank water, she decided to devise a convenient solution.

Ms Neo, who is head of post and parcel delivery and customer experience at Singapore Post (SingPost), took out her knitting needles and got to work making eight mask-strap extenders that go over the outside of the tudung, thus allowing the wearer to remove the mask more easily.

She launched into the project at the start of April and then passed them to her grateful colleagues at SingPost's Jurong delivery centre, who now find getting their face masks on and off less awkward.

“The ladies were very excited and so happy to model (the mask straps) for photos,” she said. “It was very heartwarming to see that they really like it and made me want to try knitting more of them.”

To make more mask straps for SingPost employees and others in essential services, Ms Neo created a Facebook group called Project Co-Knit with Love on Sunday (April 12).
