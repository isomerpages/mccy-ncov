### Community Foundation of Singapore commits up to S$300,000 to extend student meal subsidies during circuit breaker

The Community Foundation of Singapore (CFS) has committed up to S$300,000 in funding to extend the Recess@Home programme until the end of the “circuit breaker” on Jun 1, the Ministry of Education (MOE) said on Thursday (May 14). 

Recess@Home is a partnership between MOE, CFS and community donors that had provided meal subsidies for students during the full home-based learning period between Apr 8 and May 4. 

The programme supports students whose families have been “adversely impacted” by the COVID-19 pandemic, such as the unexpected loss of income, said the ministry.

To date, the partnership with CFS has benefited about 27,000 students in primary, secondary, junior college and special education schools during the home-based learning period, with about S$650,000 in funding, the ministry said.
