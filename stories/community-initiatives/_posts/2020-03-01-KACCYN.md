### Kolam Ayer CC Youth Network Appreciate Neighbourhood Cleaners

"It is harder than before - we clean the estate more and work for longer now, but it's ok. We want to do our best."  Hawlader Manik has been working as an estate cleaner for about 13 years now. Despite being concerned about the COVID-19 situation, he thinks that it will get better soon, if we take care of ourselves.  He was pleasantly surprised by the Kolam Ayer CC Youth Network (YEC), when they gave out dough fritters to all the cleaners in appreciation of their efforts. The YEC members also passed dough fritters to other frontliners like our bus drivers as a small token of appreciation. Genghis Tan, a YEC volunteer said "itâ€™s important to recognise the effort of frontline workers as we fight the virus together".
