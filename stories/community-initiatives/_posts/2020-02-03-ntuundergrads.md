### NTU Undergraduates Create Campaign to Combat ‘Fake News’

To tackle the spread of false information on WhatsApp, the group of four communications studies students created a campaign for their final year project called “Sure Anot”.

As part of the campaign, the team created a three-step approach called “Be Safe, Be Sure” that older adults are recommended to follow when they view messages on WhatsApp.

The campaign hopes to encourage people, especially older Singaporeans, to be more wary about the messages that they receive on the WhatsApp platform.
