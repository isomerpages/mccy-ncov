### The need is stronger for someone else - Singaporeans dip into government payouts to help others hit by COVID-19 outbreak

Like many Singaporeans, freelancer Sophia Sim has been hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic.

With her gigs having dried up, Ms Sim, who works in the film industry, is living on her savings and help from the Temporary Relief Fund. The one-off S$600 payout from the Government, disbursed as part of the Solidarity Budget on Tuesday (Apr 14), will also tide her over the difficult time.

However, Ms Sim believes there are some out there that require more help, such as Singapore's migrant workers, and hopes to contribute a portion of her payout towards this cause. 

"The need is stronger for someone else. The amount is significant to me, but it is even more significant to (others)," Ms Sim explained. "I hope it wouldn’t seem like I’m making a big sacrifice or contribution. I personally think it’s only a small thing I can do to perhaps alleviate a much bigger issue."
