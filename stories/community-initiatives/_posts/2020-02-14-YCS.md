### Youth Corps Singapore Surprise Medical Staff on Valentine's Day

Most Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH) staff that were heading to work on Friday (14 Feb) morning, or leaving for home after the night shift, had one thing in common: they all had the look of tiredness.

This is understandable, considering that they've had to work doubly hard as Singapore continues the fight against the COVID-19 (Coronavirus Disease 2019). Some were even denied their brief respite away from work, as they had to battle against discrimination from the public.

But the look of tiredness was soon replaced with a smile, thanks to volunteers and staff from Youth Corps Singapore (YCS). Through the National Youth Council, YCS came up with an initiative to give out thank you cards and care packs to healthcare workers from TTSH on Valentine's Day.
