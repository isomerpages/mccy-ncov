### Inter-Religious Organisation, Singapore joins Global Day of Prayer in Response to COVID-19

The Higher Committee of Human Fraternity has called on religious leaders and faith followers from around the world to take part in the Global Prayer Day to end COVID-19, on the 14th of May 2020. 

You too, can join Inter-Religious Organisation, Singapore in supporting this initiative by tagging your faith stories or personal prayers with the hashtag #globalprayersg.
More than ever we will need to unite and stand in solidarity so that we can emerge from COVID-19 stronger as an individual, as well as a community.
