### Progress Nest encourages frontline staff at Tan Tock Seng Hospital

Progress Nest is founded by Muhammad Akram Bin Mohammad Hanif. It is a 6-month old sustained volunteering effort by 20 youth volunteers (of diverse social backgrounds, races and nationalities) to help unprivileged students and about 45 beneficiaries who are of school-going age.

Given the current situation, Akram believes it is important for his students to pen down some words of encouragement for the frontline staff. They have prepared a banner to present to frontline staff of Tan Tock Seng Hospital to show their appreciation.
