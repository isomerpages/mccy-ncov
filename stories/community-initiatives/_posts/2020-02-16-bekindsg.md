### Be Kind SG Seeks Volunteers for Packing of Care Packages

Be Kind SG a ground-up movement made entirely of volunteers, is working on an appreciation project to create care packages for the 7000 staff of NCID and TTSH (healthcare, admin, operations etc). #OurEverydayHeroSG

REQUEST: Be Kind SG is now looking for sponsors or organisations who are willing to donate suitable items such as Halal-certified snacks and self-care items (should be similar item of 7000 pieces) for the care packages. Items can be Halal-certified snacks such as nuts, lozenges, herbal candy, mints, dried raisins/cranberries, vitamin C, or self-care items such as eye/beauty masks.
