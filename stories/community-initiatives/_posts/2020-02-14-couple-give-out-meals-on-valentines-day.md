### Couple give out meals to staff at Raffles Hospital on Valentine's Day

This couple gave up their Valentine's Day to make sure staff at Raffles Hospital had Valentine's Day meals to enjoy!

⁣
“We thought it is important for these medical staff to still have food, be it those deployed outside or inside hospitals. Especially now, all our healthcare staff are all busy taking care of patients/ ferrying suspected cases and will have almost no time for lunch/ dinner breaks. So maybe if we can just send them some food packs, it would help them get some rest and munch between shifts,” Mothership.sg, reported Zheng Libin as saying.

⁣
She and her husband were inspired to do something for frontline workers after they learnt that an ambulance driver was allegedly turned away from a food stall, over fears of the coronavirus (Covid-19).⁣

⁣
Speaking to Mothership.sg, Zheng shared that since they are running a catering service, they can at least help to ensure these frontline staff will not work with an empty stomach.⁣

⁣
They’ve been delivering sealed bento sets to staff at Raffles Hospital since February 10.⁣
