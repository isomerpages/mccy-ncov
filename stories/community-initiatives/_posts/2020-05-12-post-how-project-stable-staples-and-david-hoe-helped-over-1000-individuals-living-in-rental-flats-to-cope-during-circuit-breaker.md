### How Project Stable Staples and David Hoe helped over 1,000 individuals living in rental flats to cope during circuit breaker

When it comes to creating a ground-up initiative to make an impact, Project Stable Staples (PSS) has certainly done it.

Led by David Hoe, 33 and Francesca Wah, 28, the initiative is supporting over 1,000 individuals from 215 families in rental communities impacted by COVID-19 and are suffering from income losses during the circuit breaker. 

Currently, these families are given $5 worth of grocery vouchers to each member fortnightly, to help them get some "stable staples" - hence the name of the initiative that has raised over $85,000 so far.

The initiative started as both David and Francesca were concerned that families living in rental areas would be affected badly.

He believes that as long as everyone comes together to contribute, making a positive difference is not impossible.

"Everyone can play a part in tiding Singapore through this pandemic, be it choosing to stay home or settling for a "new normal" by catching up with friends online instead of physically to prevent community spread," said David.
