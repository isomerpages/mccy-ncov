### Cornerstone Community Church Distribute 500 Lunch Sets to Taxi Drivers

Volunteers and staff of Cornerstone Community Church took to the Changi Airport Terminals to show their care to the taxi drivers by distributing 500 free lunch sets to them. Many taxi drivers have been hit hard by COVID-19, with fewer tourist arrivals and more Singaporeans working from home. Let's continue through practical ways to stand with our fellow Singaporeans and those affected by the COVID-19 situation.
