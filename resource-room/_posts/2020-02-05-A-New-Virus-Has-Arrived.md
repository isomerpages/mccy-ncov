### A New Virus Has Arrived!: EtonHouse Community Fund releases educational book on the nCoV
_Released on 4 February 2020_

*A New Virus Has Arrived* is a very special book for children of all ages, even parents and grandparents too. With beautiful illustrations, it explains the Novel Coronavirus in a sensitive and meaningful way. 

- Facts about the virus 
- How does it affect us?
- How can you protect yourself?
- Bilingual in English and Chinese

We respect children as curious and capable individuals. They are constantly making sense of their interactions and building an understanding of the world. As parents, we have an innate desire to protect our children against anything harmful. Instead of succumbing to our fears, let us instead engage and connect with our children as we support them in navigating the world.    

We hope this book opens up opportunities for dialogue and learning, for both child and adult. 

_This publication is by the EtonHouse Community Fund (ECF), a Registered Non-Profit organization
approved by the Commissioner of Charities in Singapore and is an Institution of
Public Character (IPC)._
